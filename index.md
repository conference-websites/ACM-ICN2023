## Welcome to 10th Annual ACM ICN 2023 Conference!

<img src="assets/images/Iceland_city.jpg" style="width: 100%" />

This is the 10th installment of the ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking -- the premiere venue for publishing peer-reviewed research on all forms of Information-Centric Networking. The conference will be held in person, in beautiful Reykjavik, Iceland.

This year, the ICN conference will be held in the same week and same location as the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, which is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year.
ICN will be held October 8-10, while ICNP will be October 10-13.
This arrangement offers networking researchers an excellent opportunity to come together to exchange results and learn from each other on all topics related to networking, protocols, security, and the centrality of data in the modern world. The organizers encourage you to submit your work and/or to attend both of these conferences.
Information about discounted rates for those attending both conferences will be forthcoming shortly.
