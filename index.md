## Welcome to 10th Annual ACM ICN 2023 Conference!

This is the 10th installment of the ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking -- the premiere venue for publishing peer-reviewed research on all forms of Information-Centric Networking. The conference will be held in person, in beautiful Reykjavik, Iceland.

This year, the ICN conference will be held in the same week and same location as the 2023 IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols.
ICN will be held during the first part of the week and ICNP the latter part of the week.
We hope to encourage cross-fertilization between the communities of these two conferences by offering this exciting week of research presentations, panels, and discussions.
