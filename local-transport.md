### Busses:

- International Airport to Downtown: Shuttle busses are always available and usually are the best option. Buy tickets online or at kiosk in airport.
- Downtown busses: Get the Klappið app (https://www.klappid.is/en) for buying tickets (tickets sold on the bus are cash only and no change given).
- Downtown bus schedules on https://straeto.is or on Google maps

### Taxi:

- Hreyfill (https://www.hreyfill.is/en/) is the biggest company. Best way to order a taxi is via their mobile phone app.
- Note that taxis are somewhat expensive, at least by US standards (e.g. for the 1 mile / 4 minute drive from Hotel Natura to Gróska it will be around US$18, the 40 minute drive from international airport to downtown around 150 US$)

**Note that ride-sharing services (Uber, Lyft) do not operate in Iceland.**

### Walking:

- The venue is about 20 minutes from the downtown area and most lodging on foot.
- Downtown Reykjavik is fairly compact, and everything can be reached on foot.
