## {{ page.title }}

The ICN poster and demo sessions are intended to showcase works-in-progress.
Topics of interest are the same as those listed in the [main track call for papers](./cf-papers.html)
We strongly encourage both student and industry submissions.
Submissions should be accompanied by a two-page extended abstract, which will be published in the conference proceedings.

The posters and demos submitted to {{ site.title }} must be original and cannot be concurrently submitted to other workshops or conferences during the {{ site.title }} posters and demos review period.
All dual submissions will be rejected without review.

### Why should you submit a poster or a demo?

Presenting a poster is a great opportunity, especially for students, to obtain interesting and valuable feedback on ongoing research from a knowledgeable crowd at the conference.
Accepted posters and demos will be published as a two-page abstract for the archived conference proceedings.

### What to submit

You must submit a two-page abstract in PDF format that describes your work.
The abstract should clearly state:

- (a) the problem being addressed,
- (b) what makes this problem interesting,
- (c) your approach, and
- (d) the key contribution.

### Preparation of Abstracts

Submissions will be reviewed through a single-blind process and must adhere conflict of interest policies [the same as for the main conference papers](./cf-papers.html) (note that unlike the main track submissions, the poster/demo submissions do not need to be anonymized).
Abstracts may be up to two pages in length, excluding references, following the ACM SIGCOMM format (10pt font, `sigconf` option for `acmart` style).
The abstracts of accepted posters and demos will be available to all attendees at the conference.

### Where to Submit

A link to the submission website will be shared soon.
