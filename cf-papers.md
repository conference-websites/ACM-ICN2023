## {{ page.title }}

The 10th ACM Conference on Information Centric Networking (ICN 2023) will be held October 8-10, 2023 in Reykjavik, Iceland. The organizing committee invites you to submit your research for presentation at ACM ICN 2023. Additional conference details are available at [https://conferences.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2023](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2023).

Information-centric networking represents an approach to communications based on data names and identities, in contrast to classical networks based on addresses and channels. In 2023, we invite research papers on all ICN topics and particularly encourage submissions in the following areas.

- Experiences with real-world ICN deployments

- Challenges and opportunities with HTTP/3 and QUIC

- Design, implementation, and evaluation of ICN platforms, systems, and applications

- ICN mechanism design and evaluation, including forwarding, congestion control, and flow control

- ICN-based security applications

- ICN applications in significant emerging application areas, including vehicular networks, VR/AR/metaverse, AI/ML, IoT, and autonomous systems

In addition to full (10 pages) and short (6 pages) technical papers, ACM ICN 2023 also encourages Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers (10 pages), and short vision or position statements (2 pages; position papers may also inspire panel sessions) Submissions must adhere to the ACM SIGCOMM paper format. All submissions will be peer reviewed. Accepted papers will be published by ACM in the Digital Library.
The submission deadline for paper registration is June 05, 2023. Full papers should be submitted by June 12, 2023. All submissions will be via [https://icn23.hotcrp.com](https://icn23.hotcrp.com).

All program questions should be submitted to the TPC Chairs, Christos Papadapoulos & Patrick Crowley, via [icn23-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org](mailto:icn23-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org).

### Submission Types

ACM ICN 2023 solicits the following types of papers, page limits exclude references and appendices.:

- Full technical papers (max. 10 pages) that present mature research, typically bolstered by extensive experiments, simulations, or analytical results,

- Short technical papers (max. 6 pages) that present preliminary research, including less mature results but promising directions.

- Systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers (max. 10 pages) that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Those papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established ICN research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix **"SoK: "** in the title.

- Vision or position statements (max. 2 pages) that present crisp statements to identify and scope future research directions. This may include lessons learned from past efforts, debating on different approaches in ICN solution developments, or identifying persistent problems in today's Internet and their relations with the architecture. Those statements will provide valuable inputs to organizing panel sessions.Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix **"Statement: "** in the title.

All submissions must follow the ACM SIGCOMM format (10pt font, `sigconf` option for `acmart` style). In case of acceptance, the camera-ready format will provide more space to address reviewer comments.

Submissions will be reviewed through a double-blind process, and evaluated on the basis of intellectual merit, originality, importance of contribution to the field, soundness and strength of evaluation (for full papers), quality and clarity of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

### Submission Instructions

Papers must be formatted for printing on Letter-sized (8.5" by 11") paper. Paper text blocks must follow ACM guidelines: double-column, with each column 9.25" by 3.33", 0.33" space between columns. Each column must use 10-point font or larger, and contain no more than 55 lines of text.

Please use the current [ACM LaTex template](https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template), and the following configuration:

{% highlight tex %}
\documentclass[10pt,sigconf,anonymous]{acmart}
\settopmatter{printacmref=false, printccs=false, printfolios=true}
\setcopyright{none}
\subtitle{Paper number, XXX pages}
{% endhighlight %}

SoK papers should include **"SoK: "** in the title, vision or position statements should include **"Statement: "**.

Register and submit your paper by the deadline in the conference submission site: [https://icn23.hotcrp.com](https://icn23.hotcrp.com). ACM ICN follows a double-blind reviewing process, details see below.

If you have any questions about submitting papers to ICN 2023, or encounter problems with the paper submission site, contact the TPC chairs before the deadline via [icn23-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org](mailto:icn23-tpc-chairs@sigcomm.org).

### Submission Compliance

Papers submitted for consideration must not have been already published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the consideration period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy) and the [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/sim_submissions).

Like other conferences and journals, ICN prohibits violation of the above ACM Policies and may take action against authors who violate them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the compliance of papers under consideration. If the TPC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.

ICN will review extended versions of previously-published short preliminary papers (such as workshop papers) in accordance with published [ACM SIGCOMM policies](http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq/). Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be considered.

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

### Paper Anonymity

All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to make a good-faith effort to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Minimally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:

1. Remove the names and affiliations of authors from the title page.

2. Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.

3. Use care in naming your files. Source file names (e.g., "Alice-n-Bob.dvi") are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.

4. Check the "Properties" (metadata) embedded in the file, and remove any identifying information before submitting.

5. Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work by another author.

6. Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) carefully explain the differences between the ACM ICN'22 submission and the prior workshop paper.

### Conflicts of Interest

Both authors and TPC members must identify conflicts of interest according to the following general principles.

A program committee member (including the chairs of the committee) is considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission that has an author in any of the following categories: the person himself or herself; a past or current student or academic advisor; a supervisor or employee in the same line of authority within the past four years; a member of the same organization (e.g., company, university, government agency, etc.) within the past four years or in the near future (six months); a co-author of a paper appearing in publication within the past four years; someone with whom there has been a financial relationship (e.g., grants, contracts, consultancies, equity investments, stock options, etc.) within the past four years; someone with whom acceptance or rejection would further the personal goals of the reviewer (e.g., a competitor); a member of the same family or anyone considered a close personal friend; or someone about whom, for whatever reason, their work cannot be evaluated objectively. If there is no basis for the TPC conflicts provided by authors, however, those conflicts will be removed. Do not improperly indicate conflicts simply to prevent some TPC members from reviewing your paper.
